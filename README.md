**Important Notice**

Due to a technical error in Visual Studio, I'm currently unable to push new commits to the GitHub repository.

---
Because ofna mistake in creating the GitHub account with a personal email instead of the university email, I had to remake the GitHub account on March 5, 2025 with the correct email.

---

**After creating the new account**

- I uploaded previous project files manually to the repository without using commits.
- Currently, there's a technical issue in Visual Studio while pushing new commits.
- As a result, the repository does not show any commit history at this time.
  
---

**What's Done**
Splash Screen (Pending commit) 
Login Screen  (Pending  commit)
Previous Project Files Uploaded (Without Commits)  
Dashboard + CRUD (Pending Commit)

---

**Next Steps**
I'm working on fixing the Git Push Error and will upload all pending modifications before March 20, 2025.

Thank you for understanding!
